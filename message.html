                <p>Hello again. I don't know if you will have forgotten me when you read this, but in any case, I still remember you and miss you. I hope you miss me too, and I truly hope you are doing well now.</p>

                <p>I wanted to stay with you, but as you know, you said that I might cause problems for you, and I really didn't want to hurt you, so I stepped away. I truly hope I didn't hurt you during our time together, because those were beautiful days. It was honestly hard to leave you.</p>
                
                <p>I miss those days and I miss **Gogo** (Jojo). I hope you send her my greetings. I really hope we can get those days back without you facing any trouble. I hope you enjoyed those days as much as I did.</p>

                <p>I still remember your voice and the games we used to play, like **Ludo**, where I always used to beat you, and the Q&A games. I truly hope to relive those days.</p>
                
                <p>My best day, perhaps, was when you gave me that **Larche cake**. It was the first time I ever tried it. I haven't tried it since, and every time I see one, I remember that day.</p>
                
                <p>Don't think that letting you go was easy for me; it was extremely difficult. I wanted you to stay, but something inside me told me: "Let her go, leave her be." I didn't ask why you left then; I just let you go, and that was one of the saddest days for me. I barely ate. ðŸ˜‚</p>
                
                <p>And here I am, still stuck in those memories, unable to move past them. Every time I see you, I remember something we did together.</p>
                
                <p>Also, I've become quite alone now. There aren't many people around me; it's just me and myself. But it's also nice, without noise or disturbances, and I'm trying to adapt.</p>
                
                <p>I am honestly very sad as I write this. I don't know if I will send it, but I probably won't; I'll keep it to myself until the day you finally see it. I also have an exam tomorrow and haven't studied anything, and here I am programming this website for you, which you probably won't even see. I just wanted to say hello and then go back to how things were. I truly hope those days come back againâ€”I don't know if you wish for that too.</p>
                
                <p>In any case, you were one of the best people to enter my life, if not the best. I apologize for writing this in a programming language; the language I'm using doesn't support Arabic (A little programmer's joke!). I hope you and Gogo are well. I wish you all the best and success in your life and the realization of all your wishes.</p>
                
                <p>I know I shouldn't be sending anything, and I apologize if sending this message bothers you (if I send it). I think I will go to sleep now, feeling very sad. See you later. ðŸ˜¥</p>
